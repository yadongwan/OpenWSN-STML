# OpenWSN-STML
OpenWSN code for OpenMoteSTML platform

The OpenMoteSTML platform is a improving of OpenMoteSTM that has been tested in OpenWSN,the difference of OpenMoteSTML and OpenMoteSTM is that OpenMoteSTML uses STM32L486RG while OpenMoteSTM uses STM32F103RB.
The bennifits of OpenMoteSTML are:
- ultra low power consumption than STM32L103
- support LPTimer to implement slot schedule
- support LPUART, thus we can use the mote as a module
- support hardware AES
- powerful ablility in data processing under Cortex-M4 core and up to 80MHz
